# 🧠 Boston Process Approach (BPA) Errors Data Curation 

Curated a comprehensive dataset of categorized errors made by the participants on Framingham Heart Study’s Neuropsychological Exams (following the BPA guidelines).  Collaborated with researchers to define error types, their derivation algorithms, as well as cleaning and curation steps to process raw datasets.
