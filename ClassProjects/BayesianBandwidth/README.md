# 🕵🏽‍♀️ Estimating Distribution of Points Scored in the NBA via Bayesian and Kernel Methods.

## 🚀 Overview

This class project is originally the final project of my graduate course (MA 578, Bayesian Statistics) at Boston University.  My goal was to model complex distributions of NBA points scored using Bayesian and Kernel methods, followed by an assessment of the results.  I have since then updated my work by creating a Shiny dashboard that allows flexibility in choosing hyperparameters and timeframes, resulting in a clearer picture of the results.

## 💻 Data

This analytics project uses publicly available NBA dataset `team_season.txt` containing season-level team performances from the league's inception to 2004 from the website https://www.basketball-reference.com/.  Each row represents a team in a specific season, and their key information such as wins, points scored, rebounds, and other metrics.  The focus of this project is on the **Points Per Game (PPG)** metric, calculated as the total points scored in the season `o_pts` divided by the number of games played `won + lost`.

## 📑 Methods

$\vec{X} = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$

$$
\vec{X} = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)
